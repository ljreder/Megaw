         This page contains a list of programs used at the original Megaw Theatre
         that was open from 1974 to 1986 and located in Northridge, CA. The page is
         a temporary location for a partial collection of programs from shows produced
         back in this period.  The programs where supplied by JoAnn Iaccino (formally JoAnna
         Mashall). JoAnn designed the original Megaw logo and many of the programs
         during this period.  The programs where scanned and placed on this web page by
         Leonard Reder.  Leonard spent a couple years at Megaw as a young man assisting
         with and learning about set construction and stage lighting.<br><br>

         Megaw Theatre opened it's doors originally on September 27, 1974 with the production
         of THE LITTLE FOXES. This was almost 50 years ago.  It is my hope to grow
         this web page with production photographs and other information into a 50th.
         anniversary Megaw Theatre legacy page. The goal of the page is to preserve the
         memory for the many people that worked at Megaw Theatre.<br><br>

         Finally I would be remiss if I did not mension two people I personnally and foundly
         remember who have passed away and are no longer with us.  First there is Sydney May
         Morrison (aka. Syd) the executive producer and founder of Megaw.  Syd one summer day in 1974
         interviewed me (a junior in high school) to particapate at the Megaw as a technical
         theatre apprentice which was the beginning of a couple years of learning.  Syd was
         my advocate at Megaw and taught be about work.  Dave Lukas, an extrodonary
         theatrical set designer and scenic carpetar, would be my first true mentor. I have
         life long memories of Dave and in 1976 working almost daily hammering out set
         after at that little theatre in Northridge. For the uninitiated you will notice
         these two individuals in every single program listed. With certainty everyone
         misses Syd and Dave who knew them at Megaw.<br><br>
